Make it one app together - Artistrun Space, CIC Community etc.


FEATURES: 

Create and manage: 
- Private booking (calendar),
- Public Event / manage attendees etc,
- Study Course,
- Upload media for a group or others?; manage media in a dedicated page? I like that.
- Make your portfolio,
- Manage all your shit basically,
- Single artist feature toggle -> This will be a killer I think,


SaaSing it up:


TODO:

-X Add Context for multiple needs like theme, user, etc

-X Make a new admin panel (change Users to admin and make user a sub-page, and add configurations to a new page called settings)

3- Implement Social Signups (Start with Google, Facebook and Instagram)

5- For different hosts, work around how the groups, users, verification kind of things would be saved in the db and fetched/served/updated; and change the code accordingly without messing up what was before.

3- Create a form with custom host data that is now in settings file. This is the same one that would be used to register a new host - new client, and updates can be done here at the settings

5- Divide my-profile into sections: 
  - Basic Info (name, bio, contact, links, avatar etc)

2- Find out a good validation/error management for forms (Grommet's builtin or compatible), and update all existing forms


CAN DO WITHOUT FOR NOW:

2- Replace ant datetime with a non-moment solution (grommet)
2- Make the date time work with time zones: part of the host settings to global adjust maybe?
5- Fix the image resize problem and implement it
3- Make all relevant pages without pubsub and with method calls to fetch data. Don't forget to fetch data again if necessary
2- Drop unnecessary components like containers etc. (after making method call solution when relevant)
5- Eventually get rid off ant.design completely
8- Create portfolio feature
8- Server side render
5- Organise your menu and routes yourself? Especially needed for single-artist feature switch
5- Revisit the notifications
5- Put all the method calls to a different dedicated file "actions"
