Make it one app together - Artistrun Space, CIC Community etc.


FEATURES: 

Create and manage: 
- Private booking (calendar),
- Public Event / manage attendees etc,
- Study Course,
- Upload media for a group or others?; manage media in a dedicated page? I like that.
- Make your portfolio,
- Manage all your shit basically,
- Single artist feature toggle -> This will be a killer I think,


SaaSing it up:


TODO:

-X Add Context for multiple needs like theme, user, etc

-X Make a new admin panel (change Users to admin and make user a sub-page, and add configurations to a new page called settings)

3-X Create a form with custom host data that is now in settings file. This is the same one that would be used to register a new host - new client, and updates can be done here at the settings

2-X Date&time pickers from Grommet everywhere (group and edit left now only)

5-X Resize images

3-X Divide my-profile into sections: 
  - Basic Info about me: full name, bio, city, external links, avatar
  - Admin section (if I'm admin of an instance):
	- Basic Info: name, email, address, city, country, main description (to appear at about page)
	- Future: Email newsletter settings etc. 

5- For different hosts, work around how the groups, users, verification kind of things would be saved in the db and fetched/served/updated; and change the code accordingly without messing up what was before.

3- Form validation and error communication

3- Add admin/resources page

CAN DO WITHOUT FOR NOW but needs to be done:

2-X Replace Ant Design's Row/Col with another Grid solution. Try Grommet's Grid. Should work.
3- Make all relevant pages without pubsub and with method calls to fetch data. Don't forget to fetch data again if necessary
2- Drop unnecessary components like containers etc. (after making method call solution when relevant or check what's the trend on Meteor) 
3- Implement Social Signups (Start with Google, Facebook and Instagram)
5- Eventually get rid off ant.design completely
8-X Create portfolio feature
5-X Fix the image resize problem and implement it
5- Revisit the notifications
3- Calendar settings: Calendar categories (bookables etc. I need a way to abstract calendar entries, categories bookables etc) Perhaps I should divide them since they can coexist? Like I booked the -MonSoon studio-, for a -Reiki- session.
5- Schema validation on mongo
5- Prop types for components
3- Implement custom AUTH like in Librella. Actually build some reusable components with hooks. Eh wait a bit. 
5- Media: Images/Documents where you can see your uploaded documents and images etc. You can delete them here. Perhaps you can't upload there, because you have to be relevant to context no? I like this idea.
5- I8TL

8- Server side render
